# October 2026 Cognitive Architecture Review — Month-to-Date

## MONTHLY_STATE

- Repository: lostlight530/reflective-continuum
- Native Monthly Task: R5
- Target Month: 2026-10
- Month Closure Status: OPEN
- Record Provenance: HUMAN_AUTHORIZED_MONTH_TO_DATE_BASELINE
- Original Natural-Month R5 Execution: NOT_DUE
- Final Phase / Cognitive Architecture Audit: NOT_DUE
- Maintenance Producer: GPT Web Maintenance Agent
- Extra Audit: NO

## PURPOSE

This file is the October relational owner for maintenance.
It is not a Jules-native R5 execution and does not convert Daily runtime evidence into a monthly health verdict.
Historical Daily, Weekly, logs, rollback records and September R5 remain unchanged.

### Coverage decisions

| In-scope October-1 surface | Decision | Preserved boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEARCH/daily/2026-10-01-dehydrated-report.md` and its `ingestion.log` evidence | REVIEWED / NO_FOLLOW_UP | ACCEPTED / REJECTED_FROM_INGESTION / HARD_ROLLBACK remain local control-flow evidence |
| `RESEARCH/daily/2026-10-01-cortex-selfcheck.md` | REVIEWED / NO_FOLLOW_UP | `Nodes=0 / Edges=0` remains `INDETERMINATE_EMPTY_STATE`; cause is not inferred |
| October monthly relational owner through the 2026-10-01 A2 section | REVIEWED / NO_FOLLOW_UP | same date does not establish shared persistent-store identity |
| retained 27-total / 26-passed / 1-failed test result | REVIEWED / NO_FOLLOW_UP | non-all-green count is preserved; unnamed failure is not diagnosed by maintenance |

### A1 disposition
