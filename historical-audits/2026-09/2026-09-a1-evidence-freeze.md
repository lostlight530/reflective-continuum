# 2026-09 A1 Evidence Freeze — reflective-continuum

## Record identity
- Repository: `lostlight530/reflective-continuum`
- Period: 2026-09
- Record class: HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE_FREEZE
- Phase: A1
- Logical boundary: repository evidence visible on 2026-09-30
- Starting main SHA: `1e8664bf355396b2e48ff3a1c22109109596aa66`
- Focus: Reflective state / cognitive architecture / evidence-preserving self-observation
- Mutation class: additive documentation only
- Historical rewrite: NO
- Runtime execution by this record: NO
- External claim generation by this record: NO
- Evidence source for this record: already-merged repository history and current repository structure
- October evidence consumed: NO
- Purpose: freeze what September evidence actually says before A2 reconciliation

## Interpretation contract
- This file is a repository-history freeze, not a new experiment.
- It does not turn a prior observation into stronger evidence.
- It does not infer missing timestamps, causes, transitions or test outcomes.
- It does not rewrite prior Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Stage, Cortex or research records.
- It does not claim that a missing check passed.
- It does not convert documentation state into runtime state.
- It does not convert conceptual mapping into implementation.
- It does not convert a current display into a dated historical transition.
- It does not count repeated same-lineage observations as independent corroboration.
- It establishes the predecessor state that A2 must reconcile.

## Repository-specific September evidence
1. PR #391 appended September phase-analysis and cognitive-architecture supplemental audits.
2. The cognitive-architecture supplement recorded 11 modules and 569 code lines at that audit cut.
3. The same supplement recorded 27 tests: 26 passed and 1 failed.
4. PR #391 kept MANIFESTO alignment ANALYSIS_INCONCLUSIVE and Recommendation Status RECOMMENDATION_BLOCKED.
5. The phase-analysis supplement marked Liquid Hours, Gas Hours, Transition Count and related transition metrics MISSING_LOG_DATA.
6. PR #391 did not manufacture synthetic or operational transition counts from absent logs.
7. PR #390 created the 2026-09-30 R2 cortex selfcheck.
8. R2 recorded an empty DB state as INDETERMINATE_EMPTY_STATE with multiple possible causes rather than choosing one.
9. PR #389 processed three R1 signals: two accepted and one rejected after reflection depth exhaustion.
10. PR #389 retained a hard rollback trace as evidence rather than smoothing the failed path away.

## Evidence-class separation
| ID | Evidence class | A1 treatment | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| E01 | Merged repository history | RETAIN | PR metadata and committed files are repository facts. |
| E02 | External-source statements already present in merged records | RETAIN_WITH_ORIGINAL_BOUNDARY | No authority upgrade is performed here. |
| E03 | Current-state labels | RETAIN | Current display is not automatically a transition date. |
| E04 | Unverified dates | UNVERIFIED | No backfill or interpolation. |
| E05 | NOT_EXECUTED checks | NOT_EXECUTED | Absence of execution is preserved. |
| E06 | Failed tests or degraded runs | RETAIN | Negative evidence is not erased. |
| E07 | Conceptual mappings | CONCEPTUAL_ONLY | No implementation credit. |
| E08 | Controlled-model results | CONTROLLED_ONLY | No deployed-system generalization. |
| E09 | Index or routing membership | METADATA_ONLY | No scientific-validation credit. |
| E10 | October state | OUT_OF_SCOPE | This A1 freezes September predecessor state only. |

## Documentary audit checks

- A1-C02: Starting main SHA is pinned.
- A1-C03: The period is explicitly September 2026.

- A1-C05: The record is additive.
- A1-C06: No existing historical file is overwritten.
- A1-C07: No runtime claim is introduced by this record.
- A1-C08: No external-source claim is strengthened by this record.
- A1-C09: Merged PR evidence is separated from inferred interpretation.
- A1-C10: Negative or degraded evidence is retained.

- A1-C12: Missing data remains missing.
- A1-C13: NOT_EXECUTED work remains NOT_EXECUTED.
- A1-C14: Conceptual mapping remains conceptual.
- A1-C15: Implementation status is not upgraded.
- A1-C16: Test status is not upgraded.
- A1-C17: Index presence is not treated as execution evidence.
- A1-C18: Routing presence is not treated as scientific evidence.
- A1-C19: Current-state display is not treated as transition chronology.
- A1-C20: Same-lineage repetition is not treated as independent corroboration.
- A1-C21: Daily and weekly cadence boundaries are preserved.
- A1-C22: Cross-month W40 semantics are not forced into a false September completion.
- A1-C23: Repository-local terminology is retained.
- A1-C24: No new ADR is implied by chronology alone.
- A1-C25: No new stage is implied by chronology alone.
- A1-C26: No capability calibration is implied by temporal freshness.
- A1-C27: No system-health claim is inferred from module-health observations.
- A1-C28: No causal explanation is selected for an indeterminate empty state.
- A1-C29: No absent source is treated as evidence of no change.
- A1-C30: No absent log is converted into a numeric transition metric.
- A1-C31: No controlled-model success is generalized to production.
- A1-C32: No external failure mode is relabeled as a local incident.
- A1-C33: No failed path is removed from historical accounting.
- A1-C34: No October asset is consumed early.
- A1-C35: A2 must start from a main that contains this A1 record.

## Carry-forward contract into A2
- R1: Keep empty-state interpretation indeterminate without ingestion-path evidence.
- R2: Keep failed tests visible in monthly history.
- R3: Do not derive transition metrics from missing logs.
- R4: Separate module-health checks from end-to-end system-health claims.
- R5: October evidence should preserve rollback and rejected-signal traces as first-class artifacts.
- A2-H01: A2 must read this A1 from merged main, not from an unmerged branch.
- A2-H02: A2 may reconcile September state but may not rewrite source records.
- A2-H03: A2 must distinguish closed facts from open questions.
- A2-H04: A2 must preserve every unresolved item that lacks resolving evidence.
- A2-H05: A2 must preserve every failure/degradation marker that remains relevant.
- A2-H06: A2 must identify what becomes the clean October baseline.
- A2-H07: A2 must not claim future October execution.
- A2-H08: A2 must remain additive and auditable.
- A2-H09: A2 must state the exact predecessor A1 path.
- A2-H10: A2 must keep evidence and recommendation sections separate.
